ZIPPER is a program that zips OS/390 files in PKZIP/WINZIP compatible
       format and saves the resultant zip file as an HFS file.

The zip logic employed is extremely fast and is specifically
designed to zip output-based reports; i.e. do not use this program
to zip load modules, etc.
The input file should be RECFM=FBA with ANSI control characters.
Our testing has achieved zip compression ratios of 50%-75%.
Other OS/390 JAVA-based zip programs that we wrote have achieved
90% compression but are extremely slow.
As an example, we have zipped 2+GB reports down to 450 MB in about
15-20 minutes.

Our requirements dictated that every 50 pages of output,
as counted by "1" carriage controls, results in 1 zip "chunk" file.
Thus, the resulting zipped file for a report of 175 pages will
contain 4 embedded files of 50 pages each except for the last file
named block0, block1, block2 and block3.

I will be adding doc to explain the zip logic.
As is, the source is probably very difficult to follow but
also shows how to write an HFS file from assembler language.

SAMPLE JCL AS FOLLOWS:
//STEP1    EXEC PGM=ZIPPER,   <== Load module name
// PARM='/sysda/test.zip' <== Target HFS zipped directory/filename
//*
//STEPLIB  DD   DSN=xxxxxxxxxxxxx.LOADLIB,DISP=SHR
//*
//INPUT    DD   DISP=OLD,DSN=your-input-dsname=here  <== input dsname
