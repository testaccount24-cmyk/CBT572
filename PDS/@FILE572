//***FILE 572 is from Jeff Kaplan and contains zip programs that    *   FILE 572
//*           run on MVS.  As written, these programs are quite     *   FILE 572
//*           specialized in what they do, but they are a beginning *   FILE 572
//*           to show us the way.                                   *   FILE 572

//*           There are two packages here.  One is a zip program    *   FILE 572
//*           written in Assembler, which puts its output to an     *   FILE 572
//*           HFS file, and which is designed to zip big reports    *   FILE 572
//*           relatively quickly.                                   *   FILE 572

//*           The second program is written in JAVA, and is a very  *   FILE 572
//*           high-compression program compatible with the common   *   FILE 572
//*           zipping programs from other platforms.                *   FILE 572

//*           ZIPPER   - An assembler program designed to zip       *   FILE 572
//*                      large reports with ANSI control            *   FILE 572
//*                      characters.  If the report exceeds a       *   FILE 572
//*                      certain size, then the program breaks      *   FILE 572
//*                      the resulting zipped files into chunks.    *   FILE 572
